          <p class="top-news__text">Who among us does not want to be forever young? Well, if not in the passport, then at least outwardly. But best of all and internally be young! Unfortunately, time can not be stopped. You can only slow down the impact of time on appearance.
            <br> The natural light that healthy skin radiates, cosmetic procedures or expensive anti-aging creams can’t provide. Such a light which even the imperfections of your skin or wrinkles can not be afraid of, can only be found in skin, health of which we provide ourselves, from the inside.
            <br> In today's world, no one wants to look even a day older than his age, and therefore modern science does not sit idle: how many remedies have been invented and developed, "medicines" for longevity, and the beauty industry is not even worth talking about! But the main secret of beauty, youth and health is still food. Regular use of foods that contain an abundance of vitamins and nutrients works better than any cream.
            <br> From experience we know that the state of our skin depends on what we eat. A balanced diet and healthy food will help rejuvenate skin and will shed some years from our true age. Some of the studies have shown that if you eat certain foods, it can greatly affect the reduction of cell damage, that is, slow down the aging process in this way.
            <br> Everyone knows that it is very important to eat a large number of vegetables. However, it is not so widely known that the most useful vegetables are green, including in the dealing with aging. Many of them are rich in substances such as carotenoids, zeaxanthin and lutein, beta-carotene, iron, calcium and folate salts. Also, they contain many antioxidants - substances that are simply necessary for the human body. Antioxidants remove free radicals from the body, preventing the development of cancer tumors and premature aging of a body. Also, green vegetables reduce the negative impact on the body from ultra-violet rays.
            <br> Skin aging happens due to external and internal causes. The external cause is exposure to skin of the sun's rays (photoaging), which in almost 80% of cases is responsible for premature aging of the skin. Photoaging (as well as skin cancer) is caused by the ultraviolet part of the solar spectrum.
            <img src="assets/pictures/greeny.jpg" class="top-news__img-left">
            <br> Photo-aging causes dry skin, deep wrinkles, sagging of skin, loss of elasticity and the appearance of pigmented spots. Although your own, or chronological skin aging is programmed genetically, and it is difficult to control, photoaging can be prevented or slowed down.
            <br> Other external factors of skin aging are the effects of contaminants and irritants, allergens, smoking and various skin lesions.
            <br> The main culprits of skin aging are free radicals. The cause of excessive formation of free radicals can be ultraviolet, contaminants, stress, age changes or illness. Free radicals are very reactive molecules. They attack molecules of fats, proteins, sugars, DNA, causing their oxidation. As a result free radicals damage of lipids, collagen and proteins, skin loses its elasticity, strength and moisture contained in it; Damage of DNA can lead to skin cancer.
            <br> Antioxidants reduce the damage to skin by free radicals because they prevent their excessive formation, neutralize the formed free radicals before they damage other molecules, and repair damaged molecules.
            <br> Antioxidant defense of a body consists of many components, some of which are formed in our body (endogenous), while others we get from food (exogenous).
            <br> The use of external skin care products alone can not ensure its full nutrition and optimal protection, which means it can not keep your skin young and healthy. It is also necessary to ensure that in your diet, products contain the necessary nutrients for skin. The intake of these substances with food or in the form of bio additives has a direct impact on the appearance and health of your skin, although this fact is often given insufficient attention.
